# Project Overview

This project includes Jupyter Notebooks that combine Kaggle datasets with the power of Scikit-learn and PyCaret to perform classification and regression analysis.

# Datasets

* <b>New York Taxi Dataset</b>: Used for predicting taxi fares or other relevant metrics within the new_york_taxi.ipynb and new_york_taxi_pycaret.ipynb notebooks.
* <b>Rain in Australia Dataset</b>: Utilized to develop prediction models related to rainfall in the rain_in_australia.ipynb and rain_in_australia_pycaret.ipynb notebooks.
* <b>Rossmann Dataset</b>: Employed for tasks such as sales forecasting rossmann.ipynb notebook.

# Notebooks

* <b>new_york_taxi.ipynb</b>:
Utilizes Scikit-learn for traditional machine learning approaches to analyze and model the New York Taxi Dataset.
* <b>new_york_taxi_pycaret.ipynb</b>:
Leverages PyCaret to efficiently explore, preprocess, and model the New York Taxi Dataset, streamlining the machine learning process.
* <b>rain_in_australia.ipynb</b>:
Employs Scikit-learn to create machine learning models focused on the Rain in Australia Dataset.
* <b>rain_in_australia_pycaret.ipynb</b>:
Streamlines the machine learning workflow for the Rain in Australia Dataset using PyCaret.
* <b>rossmann.ipynb</b>:
Applies Scikit-learn to address challenges pertaining to the Rossmann Store Sales dataset.
